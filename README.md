# FIFA Visualization_project
The following files are attached to the project:
- preprocess on the data frames (ipynb file)
- The data files after preprocessing
- the final report (pdf file)
- the final visualization code (py file) 

In the FIFA game, each player has a general rating (overall) and a rating of all his personal abilities on a scale
of 1-100.
The subject of the project is the relationship between the player's personal ability ratings and his overall rating in the game
throughout the years 2017-2022. We would like to analyze this to see how these fit
on his rating, according to the position of the player.
We use the "FIFA 2023 Official Dataset" repository from the "Kaggle" site which contains 6
Data frames for the years 2017-2022. Each of the data frames contains about 17,000 records, where each
record represents a player. In addition, each of the data frames contains about 65 columns, some of which represent personal data
(age, position, group, nationality, etc.) and some represent ratings of his personal abilities.
The primary key for each of the data frames is the player's ID.
